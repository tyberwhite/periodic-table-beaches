Sorting
--------------------------------

Water Temperature vs. Crowds: You could plot the beaches based on their average water temperature along the x-axis, and the level of crowds or visitors along the y-axis. This would allow you to see which beaches are warmer and less crowded, and vice versa.

Water Clarity vs. Wave Height: You could plot the beaches based on the clarity of the water along the x-axis, and the height of the waves along the y-axis. This would allow you to see which beaches have clearer water with calmer waves, and which ones have murkier water with bigger waves.

Natural Beauty vs. Amenities: You could plot the beaches based on their level of natural beauty or scenic views along the x-axis, and the amenities or facilities available at the beach along the y-axis. This would allow you to see which beaches are more natural and unspoiled, and which ones have more amenities like restrooms, showers, and concessions.
